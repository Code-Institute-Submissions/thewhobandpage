Front End Development The Who Bandpage
This is website made in the perspective of the band The Who and its manager.  This website encomposes The Who's biography, calender, photos, 
videos, and music. On the calendar page there is a section that allows the visitor to request the band for private parties, weddings, 
and concert venue owners. This site will help concert venue owners, fans, and potential fans get information about the band, listen 
to music, watch music videos, and request concerts with the band from the manager.  

UX
This site was made with the mobile first appraoch with a user experience that always have user-ease in mind.  The site will require
the least amount of clicks necessary while giving content directly to users.  

As a user everything on the site is found in just one click with the simple yet effective navbar on every page.

As a user it is important to be able to connect with the band through popular social media site, those site 
are on the footer of every page with direct links to their various pages while opening in a new tab to never 
forget what site they came from.

As a user, simplicity is needed while looking for what they want.  To achieve that, the sites functionality allows
users to have simple yet effective means to find information fast.  



 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.




Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The Home screen allows the user to 
Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
