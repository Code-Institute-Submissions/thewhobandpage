Front End Development The Who Bandpage
This is website made in the perspective of the band The Who and its manager.  This website encomposes The Who's biography, calender, photos, 
videos, and music. On the calendar page there is a section that allows the visitor to request the band for private parties, weddings, 
and concert venue owners. This site will help concert venue owners, fans, and potential fans get information about the band, listen 
to music, watch music videos, and request concerts with the band from the manager.  

UX
This site was made with the mobile first appraoch with a user experience that always have user-ease in mind.  The site will require
the least amount of clicks necessary while giving content directly to users with ease.  

As a user everything on the site is found in just one click with the simple yet effective navbar on every page.

As a user there there is a footer with some band details and additional hyperlinks to direct to different parts of the website without having 
to scroll back to the very top of the page.

As a user it is important to be able to connect with the band through popular social media site, the social media pages 
are on the footer of every page with their popular symbols with direct links to their various pages while opening in a new tab to never 
forget what site they came from.

As a user, simplicity is needed while looking for what they want.  To achieve that, the sites functionality allows
users to have simple yet effective means to find information fast.  



 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.




Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The Home screen allows the user to learn more about the band including see the current and all past lineups. In that home page there are also details from the band, like the amout of time played, records sold and interesting facts about the band.  
On the Music Videos and Photos page this allows users to experience the band and some of the most iconic photos and music videos that have been preformed over the last 5 and a half decades of the bands existance. 
The Calendar screen provides a list of all upcoming concerts for the bands current tour and the availability for users that want the band to preform for weddings private parties and coorporate events to get in contact with the business manager to try to set that event up.
The MP3's screen will aloow users on the go to listen to some of the bands most iconic hits.  These are different than the featured videos on the site but will allow users that may have a slower internet speed or not wanting to deal with videos to still enjoy the band. 
The Thank you screen will br brought up for all users who submit an application to book an event.  This helps users get the feedback that their event request was received and will be taken care of. 
The Header in each page allows users to simply and effectively browse the different aspects that the site provides and provides clarity to know exactly what is needed. 
The Footer connects the user to different places on the website in a different way like clickig on a short biography to return to the home band page to learn more about the band.  The footer also has a place to click to see current tour dates and even connect the user to social media sites of the band.  

Features Left to Implement
The featured videos and MP3's will be updated regularly to keep the traffic coming, along with new songs before they are given to the general public.  
Having The Who shop that has all the band appearal, tickets, and merchandise.
Having a premium subscriber section that lets users have discounted prices on merch and tickets available before going on sale on places like ticketmaster.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

This project used HTTP5, CSS3, bootstrap, SASS, and font awesome.

I used the outline of a timeline from code pen, found here (https://codepen.io/bsngr/pen/Ifvbi) and changed icons, information, and colors to make it to a tour date schedule that includes all relevant information. 

A CSS button from W3Schools found here (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp).  This was for the submit button for the form on the calendar page.

For the MP3 audio I used W3 again (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp). This added the ability to have an MP3 page where fans can help listen to music who may be on their phones with limited data use or people who have slower connections so all fans can still listen to The Who. 

Bootstrap was used to keep the 1/3 2/3 ratio to seperate the pages body and make sure that the ratio changes depending on screen size.

For the header on each page (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.3.1/css/hover-min.css) effects were controled through here.  This helped transitions look professional and reliable having the UX appealing and easy to use.

Font awesome from bootstrap (https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css). This allowed different areas to have slightly different fonts depending on what was needed or have the desired appeal more easily. 




Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, 
link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.



Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
